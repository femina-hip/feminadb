      search term to "Save the Children" and try again.

    %p
      If you have too many search results and you cannot find the Customer

      Underneath the Search field you can refine the search. Choose a
      search field and write some text, then click "Refine".

      For example: if you searched for "NGO" and cannot find what you want,
      Search for "Region" containing "Dodoma" and click "Refine".

      %dt Notes
      %dd
        Any comments we have about the Customer. Any information at all.
        For example: "I called this Customer and told him we would send
        50 Si Mchezo!"; "The Customer said he did not receive the latest
        issue of Fema"; "I tried the phone number and it did not work";
        "I don't like this guy"; anything!
