  %p
    FeminaDB has two different kinds of orders: Orders and Standing Orders.
    This page describes which orders do what.

%h2 Standing Orders

%p
  A Standing Order marks that there should be an Order for each future
  issue of a Publication. For instance, <q>Save the Children in Zanzibar
  receives 25 copies of every new Issue of Fema</q>.

%p
  Standing Orders do not relate to the past. They only relate to the next
  Issues. When a new Issue is created, the Publication's Standing Orders
  are used to create Orders for that Issue.

%p
  Only periodical Publications should have Standing Orders.

%p
  The list of all Standing Orders for a particular Publication is what we
  informally refer to as <q>The List</q>.

%h2 Orders

%p
  An Order is the physical movement of Copies from point A to point B. For
  instance, <q>Save the Children in Zanzibar received 25 copies of Fema 6
  via East Africa Movies</q>.

%p
  An Order relates to an Issue (as opposed to a Standing Order, which
  relates to a Publication).

%p
  Orders are handled by the Distribution Officer. The Distribution Officer
  must be aware of every Order.

%p
  Typically, when an Issue is created, several Orders will be filed against
  it. The Distribution Officer will ensure that the Orders are
  successfully completed; any problems will be added as Notes to the
  Customer and/or Issue in question.
