dependent => :protect option
============================

Adds a new option :protect for the parameter :depends from has_many method.
This option forbids destroying records with associated records in a
association created with :dependent => :protect option, more or less like
"ON DELETE RESTRICT" SQL statement. If you try to destroy a record with
associated records it will raise a ReferentialIntegrityProtectionError (defined
also in this plugin).

Based on the idea and the code from diego.algorta@gmail.com in Ruby on Rails
ticket #3837 (http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/3837).
